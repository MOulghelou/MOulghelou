# Mourad Oulghelou - Personal Website

## About Me

I am **Dr. Mourad Oulghelou**, a postdoctoral researcher at **Sorbonne University**, where I work at the intersection of **fluid mechanics**, **data-driven modeling**, and **machine learning**. My research focuses on developing **reduced-order models (ROMs)** and leveraging **machine learning** techniques to improve traditional fluid dynamics simulations, specifically for **turbulence modeling**.

I specialize in the creation and application of **manifold-based interpolation techniques**, from **projection-based ROMs** to **data-driven model reduction approaches**. I have developed innovative methods, including the **GILD (Geometric Interpolation of Latent Dynamics)** approach, and I am currently focusing on improving **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)** simulations using machine learning to create hybrid models that improve turbulence closure predictions.
