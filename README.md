# Mourad Oulghelou - Personal Website

## Introduction

Welcome to the personal website of **Mourad Oulghelou**, postdoctoral researcher at Sorbonne University. My research lies at the intersection of **fluid mechanics** and **machine learning**, with a focus on **reduced-order modeling**, **turbulence modeling**, and **optimization problems**. This website serves as a platform to present my academic profile, research contributions, publications, and professional experience.

Here, you will find detailed information on my research projects, my latest publications, and access to my curriculum vitae (CV). My aim is to present my work clearly to potential collaborators, employers, and those interested in the fields of applied mathematics and computational fluid dynamics.

## Research Areas

My research covers a wide range of topics in applied mathematics, fluid mechanics, and computational modeling. Some of the primary areas I focus on include:

- **Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics**: Exploring how data-driven methods can enhance traditional fluid flow models.
- **Reduced-Order Modeling**: Developing adaptive projection-based methods for optimal flow control and model reduction, particularly focusing on parametric flow models.
- **Turbulence Modeling**: Creating data-driven closure models to improve the accuracy of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations for complex turbulent flows.
- **Optimization and Inverse Problems**: Applying optimization techniques to improve fluid flow control in various engineering applications.

## Publications

I have authored and co-authored several peer-reviewed articles in leading journals such as the **Journal of Computational Physics**, **Computers & Fluids**, and **Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering**. You can find the complete list of my publications on the **Publications** page of this website, including links to the full texts and DOIs for easy access.

Some recent publications include:

1. _"Least-squares pressure recovery in Reduced Order Methods for incompressible flows"_ - Journal of Computational Physics, 2024.
2. _"Greedy identification of latent dynamics from parametric flow data"_ - Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics, 2024.
3. _"A surrogate optimization approach for inverse problems: Application to turbulent mixed-convection flows"_ - Computers & Fluids, 2022.
