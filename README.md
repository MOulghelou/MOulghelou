# Mourad Oulghelou - Personal Website

## About Me

I am **Dr. Mourad Oulghelou**, a postdoctoral researcher at **Sorbonne University**, specializing in **fluid mechanics**, **machine learning**, and **reduced-order modeling**. My primary research interest lies in **bridging data-driven approaches with traditional fluid dynamics models**, particularly focused on improving the accuracy of **turbulence closure models** for complex turbulent flows. 

I hold a **Ph.D. in Fluid Mechanics** from La Rochelle University, where I developed adaptive reduced-order models for optimal flow control. Since then, my research has centered on **machine-learning-assisted reduced-order modeling** (ROM) and integrating modern **machine learning** techniques into **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)** turbulence modeling. My work aims to enhance **predictive accuracy** and reduce computational costs for large-scale simulations in engineering applications.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the application of machine learning and data-driven techniques to classical problems in fluid dynamics and optimization. Specifically, my interests include:

- **Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-Order Models**: Developing **projection-based reduced-order models** (ROMs) to achieve fast, accurate simulations of fluid flows. These models use **parametric data-driven approaches** to interpolate solutions over complex manifolds, such as **Grassmannians** and **SPD/SPSD matrices**.
  
- **Machine Learning for Turbulence Modeling**: Using **machine-learning-assisted turbulence closure models** to bridge the gap between traditional **RANS models** and advanced data-driven methods. I work on **adaptive closure models** that are capable of improving flow predictions in turbulent regimes.

- **Optimization and Control of Fluid Flows**: Applying **optimization techniques** and **model reduction** to solve **inverse problems** and achieve **real-time control** of fluid flows. This includes exploring **surrogate optimization** methods for turbulent mixed-convection flows and leveraging **reduced-order models** for optimal control applications.

- **Multi-Fidelity Data Treatment**: Exploring **multi-fidelity models** that combine **high-accuracy simulations** with **low-fidelity data-driven models** to optimize computational efficiency in predicting fluid dynamics.
