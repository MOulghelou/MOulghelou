## About Me

I am **Dr. Mourad Oulghelou**, a postdoctoral researcher at **Sorbonne University**, where I focus on cutting-edge research that bridges **fluid mechanics**, **machine learning**, and **reduced-order modeling**. My journey in applied mathematics has led me to develop new methods for **real-time flow control** and **data-driven turbulence modeling**, aiming to address computational challenges in modern engineering applications.

My work centers on creating efficient, high-fidelity models for complex fluid dynamics problems by integrating both classical and data-driven approaches. I specialize in developing **reduced-order models (ROMs)** using manifold-based interpolation and projection techniques, and recently, I have been working on applying **machine learning** to improve **turbulence closure models** for **Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)** simulations.

## Research Overview

My research has evolved from classical projection-based ROMs to purely data-driven methods, focusing on integrating **manifold interpolation**, **data assimilation**, and **machine learning**. Below are the main areas of my research contributions:

### 1. **Parametric Projection-Based ROMs for Real-Time Flow Control**
During my Ph.D., I developed **projection-based reduced-order models** (ROMs) to achieve real-time, parametric flow control. I used **Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)** bases, interpolating them on the **Grassmann manifold** to efficiently represent parametric fluid flows. Additionally, I explored the **Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD)** to handle high-dimensional problems with an adaptive and efficient basis construction.

- **Potential Visualization**: An animated graphical representation of a parametric flow control system using ROMs. This can show the interpolation process of POD bases on a Grassmann manifold, highlighting real-time optimization of flow control.
- **Suggested Placement**: On the **Research** page, under the section describing your Ph.D. work.

### 2. **Advances in Manifold-Based Interpolation in the Quotient Manifold**
In my first postdoctoral position, I worked on developing a new method for **interpolation in quotient manifolds**, pushing the boundaries of projection-based reduced-order models. This approach improved the efficiency and robustness of reduced-order models in complex parametric settings, especially for problems in fluid dynamics where computational costs need to be minimized without compromising accuracy.

- **Potential Visualization**: A dynamic 3D model of a quotient manifold with animated paths showing interpolation processes between parametric solutions.
- **Suggested Placement**: On the **Research** page, within the postdoctoral research section to demonstrate your contribution to manifold interpolation techniques.

### 3. **The GILD Approach: Data-Driven Model Reduction**
After advancing projection-based models, my research shifted towards a purely data-driven paradigm. I developed the **GILD (Geometric Interpolation of Latent Dynamics)** approach, which bypasses traditional Galerkin projections by leveraging **data assimilation** and interpolation in manifolds. GILD combines data from high-fidelity simulations and low-dimensional representations to build highly efficient reduced-order models without the need for predefined projection operators.

- **Potential Visualization**: An interactive or animated diagram illustrating how the GILD approach works, showing how data points are interpolated on a manifold and assimilated to create a reduced-order model.
- **Suggested Placement**: On the **Research** page, under the "Data-Driven Model Reduction" section, with a focus on the innovative aspects of the GILD approach.

### 4. **Current Research: Machine Learning for Turbulence Closure Models**
Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher at **Sorbonne University**, I am working on the integration of **machine learning** into traditional **RANS models** for turbulence closure. Our project aims to develop hybrid models by **blending spatially expert models** to improve the accuracy of RANS simulations. This research addresses one of the biggest challenges in computational fluid dynamics: developing accurate turbulence models that can generalize across different flow conditions while maintaining computational efficiency.

- **Potential Visualization**: A side-by-side comparison of traditional RANS solutions and machine-learning-enhanced closure models. This could be a cool animation where the blended models are visually overlaid to show improvements in accuracy.
- **Suggested Placement**: This could be highlighted on the **Home** page with an introductory animation to immediately draw attention to your cutting-edge work on turbulence modeling.
